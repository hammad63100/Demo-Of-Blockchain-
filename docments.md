Yes, this is now a functional blockchain system. Here's what it includes:

1. Core Blockchain Features:

* Proof of Data (PoD) consensus mechanism
* Block creation and mining
* Transaction verification
* File storage and verification
* Smart contract integration
* IPFS integration for decentralized storage

2. Main Components:

**/D:/blockchainscratct/pinata-starter/**

**├── blockchain.js        # Core blockchain **implementation

**├── backend.js          # API server and main **logic

**├── p2p-node.js         # Peer-to-peer networking**

**├── contracts/          # Smart contracts**

**│   ├── FileStorage.sol # File storage contract**

**│   └── QryptToken.json # Token contract ABI**

**├── utils/**

**│   └── pod-utils.js    # Proof of Data utilities**

**└── test-upload.html    # Frontend interface**

To use it:

1. Start the system:

**node** **start-services.js**

2. Access the interface:

* Open `test-upload.html` in browser
* Register/Login
* Connect MetaMask wallet
* Upload files

3. Features available:

* File upload with PoD verification
* IPFS storage
* Mining rewards
* Transaction queue
* Real-time peer updates
* File uniqueness checking
* Blockchain explorer

The system is working as a blockchain because it:

* Maintains chain of blocks
* Has consensus mechanism (PoD)
* Validates transactions
* Uses cryptographic proofs
* Is decentralized via P2P
* Rewards miners
* Has permanent storage

To verify it's working:

1. Upload a file
2. Check the blockchain explorer
3. Verify block creation
4. Check IPFS storage
5. Monitor mining rewards

* **File content → IPFS (via Pinata)**
* **File metadata → Qryptum blockchain**
* **User & uploaded files ka record → Local JSON files (`users.json`, `uploadedFiles.json`)**
* **Transaction data → Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia) ke blocks me**
