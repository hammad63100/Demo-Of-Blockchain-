Yes, this is now a functional blockchain system. Here's what it includes:

1. Core Blockchain Features:

* Proof of Data (PoD) consensus mechanism
* Block creation and mining
* Transaction verification
* File storage and verification
* Smart contract integration
* IPFS integration for decentralized storage

2. Main Components:

**/D:/blockchainscratct/pinata-starter/**

**├── blockchain.js        # Core blockchain **implementation

**├── backend.js          # API server and main **logic

**├── p2p-node.js         # Peer-to-peer networking**

**├── contracts/          # Smart contracts**

**│   ├── FileStorage.sol # File storage contract**

**│   └── QryptToken.json # Token contract ABI**

**├── utils/**

**│   └── pod-utils.js    # Proof of Data utilities**

**└── test-upload.html    # Frontend interface**

To use it:

1. Start the system:

**node** **start-services.js**

2. Access the interface:

* Open `test-upload.html` in browser
* Register/Login
* Connect MetaMask wallet
* Upload files

3. Features available:

* File upload with PoD verification
* IPFS storage
* Mining rewards
* Transaction queue
* Real-time peer updates
* File uniqueness checking
* Blockchain explorer

The system is working as a blockchain because it:

* Maintains chain of blocks
* Has consensus mechanism (PoD)
* Validates transactions
* Uses cryptographic proofs
* Is decentralized via P2P
* Rewards miners
* Has permanent storage

To verify it's working:

1. Upload a file
2. Check the blockchain explorer
3. Verify block creation
4. Check IPFS storage
5. Monitor mining rewards

* **File content → IPFS (via Pinata)**
* **File metadata → Qryptum blockchain**
* **User & uploaded files ka record → Local JSON files (`users.json`, `uploadedFiles.json`)**
* **Transaction data → Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia) ke blocks me**

The provided files are part of a blockchain project using Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum software. Here's a brief overview of each file and its purpose:

### [hardhat.config.cjs](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This is the configuration file for Hardhat using CommonJS syntax. It specifies the Solidity compiler version and network configurations.

### [hardhat.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This is another configuration file for Hardhat, but using ES6 module syntax. It also specifies the Solidity compiler version and network configurations.

### [blockchain.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This file contains the implementation of a simple blockchain and block class. It includes methods for mining blocks, verifying proofs, and managing the blockchain state.

### [transactions.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This file contains utility functions for sending and waiting for Ethereum transactions using the ethers.js library.

### [token-info.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This script retrieves and displays information about a deployed ERC20 token on the Ethereum network.

### [start-local-node.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This script starts a local Hardhat node and deploys contracts to it.

### [deploy.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This script deploys the QryptumToken contract to the specified network and saves the deployment information.

### [node-manager.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This file contains utility functions for managing local nodes, such as checking if a port is in use and killing processes on a port.

### [QryptumToken.sol](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This Solidity file defines the QryptumToken contract, an ERC20 token with additional functionalities like minting, burning, and safe transfers.

### [QryptToken.json](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)

This JSON file contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the QryptumToken contract, which is used to interact with the contract from JavaScript.

### [qryptum.config.js](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/T480s/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html)
